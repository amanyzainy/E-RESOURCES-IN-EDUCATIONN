        <p>An electronic resource is any information source that the library provides access to in an electronic format. The
                library has purchased subscriptions to many electronic information resources in order to provide you with access
                to them free of charge. Computers and related electronic resources have come to play a central role in
                education. Teachers can benefit from these resources as well, by employing a series of useful tools. Electronic
                resources consist of data representing numbers, text, graphics, images, maps, moving images, music, sounds,
                etc., and programs of instruction sets.
                Before the development of computer and internet technology, printed version of resources like books, journals,
                dictionaries, workbooks, etc. played a significant role in teaching and learning process. Therefore, of the
                different e-resources knowledge, e-resources development and preservation of them has become the need of this
                hour for teacher education. E-resources and e-learning are increasingly important to all aspects, and all levels
                of education.</p>
